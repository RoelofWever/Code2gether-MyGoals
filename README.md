# Code2gether-MyGoals
My entry for the Code2gether goal challenge
The user can enter one or several goals he/she sants to reach and the steps that are needed to reach that goal.
on the overview page the goals(s) will be shown and as the users check a step of a goals a progressbar shows the progress of that goal.
All data is saved in a xml file 
once a goal is reached or has become obsolete the done button will remove it
